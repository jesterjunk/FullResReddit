    Tested with Tampermonkey  v4.16.1  Chrome
                Tampermonkey  v5.1.0   Firefox

    This Tampermonkey script dynamically updates image URLs on reddit.com,
    converting preview image URLs to their original, full-resolution versions.
    It's designed to work automatically on page load and adjusts for new images
    that load dynamically or upon navigation within the site. The script supports
    both Chrome and Firefox via Tampermonkey and operates by identifying image
    elements with preview URLs, replacing these with their original counterparts.
    Additionally, it sets up a MutationObserver to handle new images added to the
    DOM and implements a polling mechanism to detect URL changes, ensuring that
    all images, regardless of how or when they are loaded, are processed to
    display in their original quality.
